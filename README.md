`add detail to this prompt for an image generator: landscape photograph, evening light, comet in sky, pastoral scene.`

Output: `As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the landscape, a majestic comet emerges in the sky, its tail stretching out towards the western horizon. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and freshly cut grass, while the gentle breeze carries the soft chirping of crickets and the distant hooting of owls. A tranquil pasture stretches out before us, dotted with grazing cattle and sheep, their silhouettes stark against the vibrant colors of the fading day. In the distance, a few stars begin to twinkle, adding a touch of magic to the serene scene.`
